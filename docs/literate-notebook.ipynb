Notebooks are processed by converting the notebook to a literate `.fsx` script and then passing the script through the script processing pipeline. Markdown notebook cells are passed through as comments surrounded by `(**` and `*)`, F# code cells are passed through as code, and non-F# code is passed through as markdown fenced code blocks between `(**` and `*)` comment markers. \n",
